# Setup

### Github
Github was the main tool used in order to gather all of our works combined. You can find it the following repo [here](https://github.com/AuroreVanHoorebeke/breaking-badge).
```git
git init
git clone (url)
```
### Management
We used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jNzWNQ78/breaking-badge) to keep track of our work process and made mornings and afternoons briefs to stay aligned with the final objectives.

### Design
Our website designed with a pprototype that We made with Figma.
